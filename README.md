# This is a game I made for a contest organized by the Francophone Business Club.<br><br>

I have also worked with a team to help me present my project in French.

This was made using **C#, Unity, Android Studio** and other things. 

* The [Game](https://github.com/marivsteo/Frenchie-2D-Game/tree/master/Game)
 folder contains a version for Windows.

* The [Project](https://github.com/marivsteo/Frenchie-2D-Game/tree/master/Project) folder contains the entire project.

* The [Submission](https://github.com/marivsteo/Frenchie-2D-Game/tree/master/Submission) folder contains the files I used for the submission of the project.
    * There is an installation guide along with an .apk for Android users, and the explanation of the project.
