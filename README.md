# This is a game I made for a contest organized by the Francophone Business Club.<br><br>

I have also worked with a team to help me present my project in French.

This was made using **C#, Unity, Android Studio** and other things. 

* The Game folder contains a version for Windows.

* The Project folder contains the entire project.

* The Submission folder contains the files I used for the submission of the project.
    * There is an installation guide along with an .apk for Android users, and the explanation of the project.
